# Occupation-based AI exposure scenarios

## Status: Research notes (not yet implemented)

## What we found in PolicyEngine

PolicyEngine-US has a `detailed_occupation_recode` variable (CPS field `POCCU2`) with 54 broad occupation categories (codes 0-53) at the person level.

### Data quality
- **54 unique codes** across ~50k person records
- Code 0 = not employed (~60M people, $0 mean employment income)
- Code 53 = likely "not in labor force" (~106M people, ~$4k mean income)
- Codes 1-52 = major occupation groups with meaningful employment income variation ($24k-$216k mean)
- Labels are **not included** in PolicyEngine — codes are raw integers from the CPS

### Limitation
The CPS ASEC uses ~50 major occupation groups, not the ~800 granular SOC codes that AI exposure studies typically use. Still enough for major-group-level analysis (e.g., "office/admin" vs "construction" vs "computer/math").

## What the Yale model (AI-Employment-Model) has

The Budget Lab at Yale's `AI-Employment-Model` repo produces occupation-level AI exposure scores that could feed directly into our scenarios.

### Exposure scores available
- **8 OpenAI metrics**: human rater scores (alpha/beta/gamma), GPT-4 rubric scores, and a direct automation score — from the Eloundou et al. (2023) task-level ratings
- **5 Anthropic metrics**: automation score (directive + feedback_loop), augmentation score (validation + task_iteration + learning), total tasks, and percentage of Claude conversations per occupation
- All scores range 0-1, aggregated to the occupation level using employment-weighted averages

### Crosswalks
- **SOC → CPS 4-digit**: `resources/crosswalk.csv` maps 1,015 O*NET-SOC 2019 codes to 644 unique CPS 4-digit occupation codes
- **23 SOC major groups**: `resources/soc_major.csv` provides the broad grouping (Management, Computer/Math, Office/Admin, etc.)
- **No direct POCCU2 mapping**: the 644 CPS 4-digit codes don't directly correspond to PolicyEngine's 54 POCCU2 categories — a crosswalk would need to be built

### Key data files
- `resources/crosswalk.csv` — SOC-to-CPS mapping
- `resources/soc_major.csv` — 23 major occupation groups
- `resources/national_M2024_dl.csv` — OES employment counts for weighting (1,404 rows)
- `resources/automation_vs_augmentation_by_task_v2.csv` — 3,069 tasks with Anthropic usage data
- Output `full_map.csv` (generated by `collapse_exposure()`) — final exposure scores per CPS code

### Pipeline
O*NET task statements + OpenAI exposure ratings + Anthropic usage data → task-level weights → aggregate to occupation → map to CPS codes → employment-weighted averages → `full_map.csv`

## Integration plan

### Option A: 23 major group mapping (simpler)
1. Aggregate Yale's exposure scores to the 23 SOC major groups (already computed)
2. Build a rough POCCU2 → SOC major mapping (both derive from SOC hierarchy)
3. Assign each PolicyEngine person an exposure score based on their POCCU2 code
4. Apply differential wage shocks: high-exposure = larger cut, low-exposure = smaller cut or boost

### Option B: CPS 4-digit matching (more granular)
1. Find/build a CPS 4-digit → POCCU2 crosswalk (Census documentation)
2. Use Yale's full 644-code exposure scores directly
3. More granular but requires the crosswalk work

### Option C: Income-quantile proxy (no occupation mapping needed)
1. Skip occupation codes entirely
2. Apply differential shocks by income quantile as a proxy for AI exposure
3. Less realistic but can run immediately with existing infrastructure

## Scenario idea: differential AI wage shocks

1. Map the ~50 occupation codes to AI exposure scores using:
   - [Eloundou et al. (2023) "GPTs are GPTs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130) — maps GPT exposure to occupations
   - [Acemoglu (2024)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w32487) — estimates 0.5-0.7% wage effects from AI exposure
   - [Webb (2020)](https://web.stanford.edu/~mwebb/webb_ai.pdf) — AI exposure by occupation using patent data
   - Budget Lab at Yale AI-Employment-Model — operational pipeline combining all of the above

2. Apply differential shocks to `employment_income` by occupation code:
   - High-exposure occupations: cut income 20-30%
   - Low-exposure occupations: boost income 5-10%
   - Keep total GDP constant (pure redistribution scenario)

3. Run through PolicyEngine to measure inequality/poverty/revenue effects with existing tax-benefit system
